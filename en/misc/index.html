</figure>

<p>I enjoy learning and exploring new stuffs, including new devices and technologies. I also love troubleshooting and fixing problems around me (excluding social problems :D). I spend my free time on learning new kanjis and creating interesting stuffs like DIY electronic devices, plastic models, and programs. I also love to play simulation and Real Time Strategies (RTS) games like SimCity, Age of Empires, Command and Conquer series, etc.</p>
<p>I am also a computer geek. I started with a Pentium II PC and played <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supaplex">Supaplex (a puzzle game)</a> on it. In junior high school, I got a Pentium III pc, which I played <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_%26_Conquer:_Red_Alert_%28series%29">Red Alert</a> a lot on it. In high school, my parents bought a Pentium IV PC with ATI Radeon 9200 in it, which is enough for me to spend hours on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_%26_Conquer:_Generals_%E2%80%93_Zero_Hour">Zero Hour</a>. My parents also bought an C2D 6600 with an Nvidia 8800 GTS 384 MB DDR3 on it (and yes I ran <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crysis">Crysis</a> on it). My latest computer is an Intel i7-6700 with 2xRX 480 8GB (flashed with RX 580 BIOS) in crossfire set up. (I am not sure how I can remember these strange hardware names but not the name of Indonesia&rsquo;s islands).</p>

I even wondered if it has more solution than the number of sides of the cubes, which is 6. Since then, I find that solving my problems and trying new solutions are fun.</td>

<h2 id="personal-project">Personal project</h2>
<p>Here are some of my notable project that I am proud of.</p>
<h3 id="3d-led-cube">3D Led cube</h3>
<p>Status: Postponed</p>
<p>Description :</p>
<p>An Arduino controlled project consisting of 8x8x8 (row * column * level) LEDs in a cube shape (like <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Led-Cube-8x8x8/">this</a>). The goal is to create a 3D display by using the LEDs in cube geometric. The key challenge in the project is to expand the number of the output of Arduino to control 512 LEDs, which is impossible with Arduino alone. To achieve this, I engineered a solution that used demultiplexers, which is to select row and level and latch, which is to store 8 bits. With the combinations of scanning techniques (persistence of vision (POV)), latch, and demultiplexers, we can expand the limited output of Arduino to control more than 500 LEDs with a single Arduino!</p>
<p>However, the project failed because my electricity set up in my house was not grounded properly and I killed most of the LEDs during soldering through electrostatic discharge (ESD). I learned this reason when I worked as an EMC engineer a year later.</p>
<h3 id="opencv-pencil-touch">OpenCV pencil touch</h3>
<p>Status: Completed (somehow).</p>
<p>Description:</p>
<p>This is a project that uses OpenCV, infrared camera (like Wiimote camera or CCTV camera), and printed circles to control your computer.</p>
<p>Usage instruction:</p>
<ol>
<li>First, we attach the printed circles to each corner of a monitor (4 if you have a normal monitor).</li>
<li>Aim the camera at the monitor screen.</li>
<li>Attach a printed circle to a pencil.</li>
<li>Run the program and use the pencil as a mouse to control the pointer.</li>
</ol>
<p>How does it work?:
The magic behind it is OpenCV image processing. The OpenCV code processes the images from the camera, find the circles in the camera, and finally return the coordinates of those circles to a program. With these coordinates, we can know the position of the pencil relative to the monitor screen through some mathematic formulas. Finally, the program passed the coordinate as a mouse movement such that the user can control the computer using the pencil.</p>
<p>The code is written in combination of C++ and C#. I will try to find the code and upload it to Github if I can find it.</p>
<h3 id="mic-amplifier">Mic amplifier</h3>
<p>Status: Completed.</p>
<p>Description:
The world is in crisis and most of the meetings occur online. However, good microphones cost a lot. This project uses existing stuff that I have to create a useable microphone to use in online meetings.</p>
<p>Ingredients:</p>
<ol>
<li>Electret microphone (I used one out of an unused phone mic/headphone combo).</li>
<li>MAX9814 amplifier module (my Chinese friend got it for me from China for around $2 like <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/MAX9814-Electret-Microphone-Amplifier-AGC-Function-Module-Board-DC-For-Arduino/152293733901?_trkparms=aid%3D111001%26algo%3DREC.SEED%26ao%3D1%26asc%3D20180816085401%26meid%3D2bcca8ce73e442e997c69dcc65d119ac%26pid%3D100970%26rk%3D4%26rkt%3D15%26mehot%3Dpp%26sd%3D274493598619%26itm%3D152293733901%26pmt%3D1%26noa%3D1%26pg%3D2380057%26brand%3DUnbranded&amp;_trksid=p2380057.c100970.m5481&amp;_trkparms=pageci%3Ac01370c9-5d48-11eb-84c5-a2425f0a03a9%7Cparentrq%3A2e0bca381770a4d729a1faa9ffcbfde2%7Ciid%3A1">this</a>, thanks Haku-san).</li>
<li>DAC (I used Behringer UCA202, but you can use your onboard DAC in your computer for that).</li>
</ol>
<p>Instruction:</p>
<ol>
<li>Connect the microphone and 5V supply to the MAX9814 module.</li>
<li>Connect the module to the DAC.</li>
<li>Adjust the gain to your liking.</li>
<li>Done!</li>
</ol>
<p>How does it work?:</p>
<p>MAX9814 is an auto gain controller (AGC) for electret microphones (like those in your laptops and phones). It increases or decreases sound (or normalize it) such that your voice is not too small to hear. One of the drawbacks is that the 5V supply must be clear of ripples. Using 5V from the computer might not be a good idea because the noise from the computer will also affect the output of the amplifier. I found that power banks and iPad chargers work very well without any noise with the amplifier.</p>
<p>Like this project, most of my projects idea are from minor inconvenience that I felt. I will try to add more if I remember/have more.</p>
